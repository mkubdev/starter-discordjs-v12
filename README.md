## Information

This repository is dedicated to providing a template for your discord bot/s, so you're able to skip the setup and get right into building your dream bot.
There will be various different branches with various different types of code in them.

Feel free to request features, I'll be happy to work on them on my spare time.

## Steps to usage

1) Obtain your discord bot token at [https://discord.com/developers/](https://discord.com/developers/)
2) Once you have obtained said token you can then put it within the value of the token key that you'll locate in the config.json.
3) Set a prefix and add yourself as an owner whilst in the config.json file.
4) Open up a terminal within the folder and run `npm i` or 'npm install' which will then install the necessary packages that are located within the package.json file.
5) `node .` or `npm run start`
6) Have fun !
